As the empire evolved, as Christianity reshaped European consciousness, as modern nations claimed Rome as cultural heritage, there was collective forgetting. Not conspiracy—selective memory.

We want to claim Rome as our ancestor. Our legal systems trace to Roman law. Our government structures echo Roman republicanism. When people invoke "Western civilization," Rome is what they mean.

But if we claim Rome as ancestor, we inherit all of it. Not just the Colosseum and aqueducts, but the systematic control of women's bodies. You can't take the marble statues and leave the marriage beds. They came from the same civilization.

Rome's wedding rituals show us how power perpetuates itself. How you take something fundamentally violent—grown men given sexual access to children—and make it seem not just acceptable but sacred. How you dress coercion in religious ceremony. How you turn trauma into tradition.

This is why the rituals were public. Forcing crowds to witness made them participants. Participants became defenders. Defenders became enforcers.

Power doesn't just express itself through laws and armies—it expresses itself through traditions that make its exercise seem inevitable, and then it erases the traditions when they become embarrassing.
